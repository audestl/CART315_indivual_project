Playtest 1- February 20th 2019
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

GENERAL IMPRESSIONS
- Overall, people liked the blocks that made the ball big or small (working well)
- They were curious and intrigued by the bumper that was changing colors, they were trying to hit it.
- They were surprised when the ball hit too hard and went out of the game (not suppose to happen).


WHAT TO IMPROVE
- There could be a maximum size for the ball to grow and a minimum size for the ball to shrink so that it doesn't get stuck or gets out
  of the game.
- The ball should retrieve it's initial size when the player lose and the game is restarted.
- The mechanic with the barrier in the corner should be fix so that it's functionnal
- The game could be more dynamic. More stuff moving around, more sound, more movements.

SUGGESTIONS/IDEAS
- The game could have a sens of puzzle with the bumpers. If the ball hit the bumpers in a certain color order, it would be the solution
  to open the "barrier" and access the ultimate bumper which makes you win the game.
- Sound could be played when the ball gets bigger or when it gets smaller.
- Particles could appear when the ball gets smaller/bigger
- The game could have more than one barrier that protects a bumper.

PLAYTEST 2- MARCH 6TH 2019

WHAT'S NEW
- The bumpers are changing colors from red to green and from green to red when there's a collision. The color of the bumpers are not
depending on time anymore.
- To open the door, all the bumpers need to be green.
- I removed the "getBigger" and "getSmaller" objects.
- I added a YOU WON statement when the ball collides with the bumper that was hidden.

GENERAL IMPORESSION
- The user understood quickly how the game worked.
- The user was curious by the fact that the bumpers were changing colors due to collision.
- The player wanted to reach the bumper that was blocked by the door.
- Lots of people said it was fun and that they didn't want to leave until "Winning the game


WHAT TO IMPROVE
- It needs a collision plane to prevent the ball from getting out of the plane
- It needs a timer for the OnCollisionEnter so that the bumper don't change colors too quickly.
- The ball speed should increase when it collide to bumpers and door.
- When the door is open, the color of the bumpers shouldn't change since the user gets confuse.

SUGGESTIONS/IDEAS
-More components, more doors to make it more challenging
- To win, the ball could need to fall into a hole. Therefore, the "getBigger" and "getSmaller" functions would be usefull since the ball won't be able to get into
the hole if it's too big
