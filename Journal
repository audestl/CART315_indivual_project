Playtest 1- February 20th 2019

GENERAL IMPRESSIONS

- Good ideas, people liked the blocks that made the ball big or small in general (working well)
- They were curious and intrigued by the bumper that was changing colors, they were trying to hit it.
- They were surprised when the ball hit too hard and went out of the game (not suppose to happen).
- The game could be more dynamic. More stuff moving around, more sound, more movements.


WHAT TO IMPROVE

- There should be a maximum size for the ball to grow and a minimum size for the ball to shrink.
- The ball should retrieve it's initial size when the player lose and the game is restarted.
- The mechanic with the barrier in the corner should be fix so that it's functionnal

SUGGESTIONS/IDEAS

- The game could have a sens of puzzle with the bumpers. If the ball hit the bumpers in a certain order, it would be the solution to open
  the "barrier" and access the final bumper which makes you win the game.
- Sound could be played when the ball gets bigger or when it gets smaller.
- Particles could appear when the ball gets smaller/bigger
- More than one barrier that protect a bumper
