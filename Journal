Playtest 1- February 20th 2019

GENERAL IMPRESSIONS

- Overall, people liked the blocks that made the ball big or small (working well)
- They were curious and intrigued by the bumper that was changing colors, they were trying to hit it.
- They were surprised when the ball hit too hard and went out of the game (not suppose to happen).


WHAT TO IMPROVE

- There could be a maximum size for the ball to grow and a minimum size for the ball to shrink so that it doesn't get stuck or gets out
  of the game.
- The ball should retrieve it's initial size when the player lose and the game is restarted.
- The mechanic with the barrier in the corner should be fix so that it's functionnal
- The game could be more dynamic. More stuff moving around, more sound, more movements.

SUGGESTIONS/IDEAS

- The game could have a sens of puzzle with the bumpers. If the ball hit the bumpers in a certain color order, it would be the solution
  to open the "barrier" and access the ultimate bumper which makes you win the game.
- Sound could be played when the ball gets bigger or when it gets smaller.
- Particles could appear when the ball gets smaller/bigger
- The game could have more than one barrier that protects a bumper.
